Step-by-Step Plan
🔹 1. Understand the Dataset
Use the Superstore.csv dataset. Explore key fields:

Order Date, Ship Date

Sales, Profit, Quantity

Product Category, Sub-Category

Region, State, City

Customer Segment

🔹 2. Choose a Business Theme / Story
Pick a compelling business question:

“Which regions/products are most profitable?”

“Where are we losing money?”

“Which customer segments drive the most sales?”

“What shipping modes are least efficient?”

📌 Storyline Example:

“How can the Superstore improve profitability across segments and regions?”

📊 Visualization Ideas
Chart Type	Use For	Example
Bar Chart	Compare across categories	Profit by Region
Line Chart	Trends over time	Monthly Sales Trend
Tree Map	Proportions within a hierarchy	Sales by Category/Sub-Category
Map	Geographic analysis	Sales & Profit by State
Pie Chart	Parts of whole (use sparingly)	Sales by Segment
Heatmap	Correlation matrix or sales by weekday/hour	Sales by Day/Time

📌 Best Practices
✔ Highlight Key Insights:
Use annotations or summary text to show:

Top-performing product

Region with highest loss

Unexpected trend

✔ Reduce Clutter:
Limit number of colors

Use consistent color palette

Group similar items (e.g., “Other”)

✔ Add Context:
Each chart should answer a question:

“What do I want the viewer to learn?”

✔ Dashboard Summary Slide:
Add a "Key Insights" page
